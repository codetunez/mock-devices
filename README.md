# mock-devices v8 (Desktop Edition)
mock-devices is a simulation engine that manages and runs simulated devices that connect to an Azure Iot Hub. When hosted in the Azure IoT Edge runtime, the engine will simulate Edge modules too. The simulated devices and modules implement D2C/C2D scenarios i.e telemetry, twin and commands as supported by the Azure IoT Device SDK

Each configured device/module acts independently of other devices/modules running within the engine. Each has its own model (capabilities), configuration and connection details. Devices/modules running on the same simulation engine can be a mix of connection strings, DPS, SaS, Edge modules. The engine has additional scenarios like cloning, bulk, templates and acknowledgements. See internal help

This desktop edition of mock-devices is an Electron app for Windows/Linux/OSX and provides a UX + engine single install application experience. It is part of a suite of mock-devices tools

**Other editions**
- The [mock-devices-de](http://github.com/codetunez/mock-devices-de) edition is a Docker container of the running simulation engine. It exposes a REST endpoint for control and data plane operations. Use this edition to run the Edge modules configured in a mock-devices state file (and deploy as an Edge module) It is also useful where a headless simulation experience per state file is required

- The [mock-devices-edge](http://github.com/codetunez/mock-devices-edge) edition is a Docker container configured as an Edge module that can be used to manage basic operations for running instances of mock-devices-de within the same Edge runtime. Clients can interact with the simulation engine using Twin Desired and Direct Commands making it an alternative to doing REST

- The [mdux](https://hub.docker.com/r/codetunez/mdux) edition is a Docker container build of the desktop edition. It is a fully functional UX + simulation engine mock-devices instance and is useful for dynamic module scenarios. It is feature limited to run inside containers with no access to file system. It can also be used as a "terminal" UX experience to see other running mock-devices engines connecting via IP or DNS

## State file
The state file is the current state of the simulation engine including the list of devices/modules, their capabilities and value set ups. Its also used as the load/save file for the mock-devices desktop tool. Both editions of mock-devices can create and/or utilize a state file created in ether edition with matching version numbers. It is recommended to use the desktop edition to create/manage state files

# Getting started

#### First time running the app - One Time Install and Build
From a command prompt navigate to the folder where the repo was sync'd. Perform the following command.

```
npm ci && npm run build
```

Do this every time the code is sync'd from the repo i.e. getting a new version of the app. If you are experiencing issues with this step see the _Pre-Reqs and build issues_ step below

#### Launching app (everyday use)
From a command prompt navigate to the folder where the repo was sync'd and perform the following command

```
npm run app
````

#### Usage Instructions
Help is available inside the application

## Advanced, troubleshooting, Pre-Reqs and build issues
Ensure you have the following configured for your environment

*Pre-reqs*
- Node LTS
- git

*If you are experiencing multiple build issues, try the following steps*

Clear NPM cache
```
npm cache clean --force
```

Do the install step separately
```
npm ci
```

Rebuild node-sass
```
rebuild node-sass --force
```

Do the build step separately
```
npm run build
```
